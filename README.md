- 👋 Hi, I’m Dan- 
- 👀 I’m interested in many things. One of my interests is to randomly come up with wierd ideas and code them for fun. When I do, I often challenge myself to write as little code as possible to accomplish whatever I'm working on. I'm a wierdo, I know.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning node.js AND Python. Just because.
- 💞️ I might be willing to collaborate on anything project that seems interesting, cool or just really useful. And if there is some ROI, well all to the better.
- 📫 I can be contacted at danconc@gmail.com
